# Stock-Info
This project gives you a html report of basic company information and fundamental financial metrics before buying stock. It scrapes glassdoor and uses yfinance.

I have uploaded a sample html to show how the report looks. There are lot of other features to be added here. Current version acts as mvp for this stand-alone app.

Setting up would take a little time 
```
Requirements for the project:

* Python3
* Currently works for safari in macos (support need to be added for other browsers)
* Libs are listed in requirements.txt
```
> Glassdoor scrapping is not allowed according to the terms and conditions of glassdoor. So, you can use or ignore that part at your own risk.
